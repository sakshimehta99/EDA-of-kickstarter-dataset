# EDA-of-kickstarter-dataset

This dataset is all about the Kickstarter campaign. Kickstarter is for start-up companies that are looking to launch their first products. Websites like Kickstarter and Indiegogo provide a platform for millions of creators to present their innovative ideas to the public. 
So here people publish their product and have a goal $ to achieve so we can analyze which companies reach the goal and what factors help them reach the goal. This seems quite interesting with all the information about the projects that have succeeded, failed, canceled, or are live.
After applying exploratory data analysis on this dataset, interesting insights and relations can be drawn between backers, funding received, and the goal set.
